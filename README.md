## Work Experience
**Research Assistant (_Mar 2023 - present_)**
- Prof. Yaoqing Yang
    - Working on visualizing high-dimensional loss functions
    - Studying the different phases in model learning and understanding relationships between local and global metrics
- Prof. Sarah Preum
    - Leveraging Large Language Models for custom text extraction and filtering to improve textual data annotation
    - Employing the extracted text to improve downstream text sentiment/stance detection task’s accuracy

**Machine Learning Intern @ SymphonyAI (_Jul 2023 - Sep 2023_)**
- Processed large-scale client company data to ingest in custom large language model
- Fine-tuned GenerativeAI OpenAI models to build custom Large Language Models(LLM) and respond to specific prompts

**Software Development Engineer @ Meesho (_Jul 2021 - Aug 2022_)**
- Designed and implemented large-scale cross-pod features catering to 20M daily active users
- Deployed lambda function to serve requests from AWS tg directly reducing the latency of the api by 50%
- Owned the Meesho product-over-web backend service and improved its structure to make it scalable
- Developed an internal automation tool to find the respective team POC, saving time for the entire organization

**Software Development Intern @ RoadToNaukri (_Jun 2020 - Aug 2020_)**
- Designed face-recognition module recognizing faces from the documents and live video using OpenCV
- Developed the preprocessing module for the document-engine which improved text extraction by 20%

## Projects
**CPP-Redis** Developed a miniature Redis server and client in c++ to facilitate the basic Redis commands like PING, GET, SET, TTL etc. on a single-threaded program supporting concurrency. It is able to accept multiple connections and serve them using IO multiplexing to make the requests non-blocking.

**URL shortening microservice** Designed and implemented a URL shortening microservice in Golang that allows users to shorten a URL and also Fetch the original URL for the custom shortened URL. This service uses Redis as the in-memory database to store the URLs. The API is also rate-limited so users get to make certain requests in a given amount of time.
